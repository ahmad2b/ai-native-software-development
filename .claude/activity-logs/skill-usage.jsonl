Rename folder from `03-billion-dollar-ai/` to `03-digital-fte-strategy/`\n2. Restructure from 8 lessons to 10 lessons\n3. Add 2 NEW lessons:\n   - Lesson 5: \"Four Monetization Models\" (from slides Part 11)\n   - Lesson 8: \"When NOT to Use AI Agents\" (from slides Part 15)\n\n### Lesson Updates\n1. Lesson 1: Reframe from \"Billion Dollar Question\" to \"Your Expertise as Product\" - remove redundancy with Ch1, add personal application focus\n2. Lesson 2: Keep \"Snakes and Ladders\" - minor terminology alignment\n3. Lesson 3: Reframe from \"Super Orchestrators\" to \"The FTE Advantage\" - remove Digital FTE table (now in Ch1 L10), add sales presentation tips\n4. Lesson 4: Significant update to \"Vertical Intelligence\" - add Agent Skills/SKILL.md content from slides\n5. Lesson 5: NEW \"Four Monetization Models\" - Subscription, Success Fee, License, Marketplace\n6. Lesson 6: Keep \"PPP Strategy\" - minor edits\n7. Lesson 7: Keep \"Three Requirements\" (renumbered from 6)\n8. Lesson 8: NEW \"When NOT to Use AI Agents\" - security, compliance, common pitfalls\n9. Lesson 9: Update \"Pause and Reflect\" - new monetization-focused prompts\n10. Lesson 10: Update Quiz - add 15 new questions on monetization, Agent Skills, guardrails\n\n### Content Sources\n- Agent Factory slides Part 11 (Pages 63-64): Monetization models\n- Agent Factory slides Part 15 (Pages 84-87): Security, compliance, pitfalls\n- Agent Factory slides Part 6 (Pages 37-50): Agent Skills/SKILL.md\n- Agent Factory slides Part 12 (Pages 71-73): Digital FTE economics, sales tips\n\n### Success Criteria\n- Zero redundancy with Chapter 1 content\n- All 4 monetization models clearly explained with examples\n- Agent Skills/SKILL.md format documented\n- \"When NOT to use\" guardrails included\n- Quiz covers new content areas\n- All .summary.md files regenerated\n\n### Non-Goals\n- Not restructuring other chapters\n- Not adding code examples (conceptual chapter)\n- Not changing the fundamental Snakes & Ladders or PPP frameworks\n\n### Dependencies\n- Chapter 1 Agent Factory Paradigm (completed)\n- Chapter 2 AIFF Foundation (#385 - in progress, but independent)","event":"invoke","source":"Skill_tool"}

Students learn FastAPI fundamentals, then production essentials (database, auth), then agent integration. The key insight: \"APIs are just functions, functions become tools, agents use tools.\"\n\nThis chapter is the **bare base for all learning pathways** - students wanting to build cloud-native agents can learn Claude Code → this chapter → Part 7.\n\n## NEW LESSON STRUCTURE (13 lessons)\n\n| # | Lesson | Focus | Issue |\n|---|--------|-------|-------|\n| 1 | Hello FastAPI | First app, uvicorn, Swagger UI | Existing |\n| 2 | Pytest Fundamentals | Testing endpoints (L1: Manual First) | #544 |\n| 3 | POST and Pydantic Models | Request validation, models | Existing (renumber) |\n| 4 | Full CRUD Operations | GET, PUT, DELETE patterns | Existing (renumber) |\n| 5 | Error Handling | HTTPException, status codes | Existing (renumber) |\n| 6 | Environment Variables | pydantic-settings, secrets | #542 |\n| 7 | SQLModel + Neon Setup | Real database persistence | #541 |\n| 8 | JWT Authentication | Tokens, protected endpoints | #543 |\n| 9 | Password Hashing + Rate Limiting | Argon2, abuse protection | #546 |\n| 10 | Dependency Injection | Depends(), repository pattern | Existing (renumber) |\n| 11 | Streaming with SSE | Server-Sent Events foundation | Existing (renumber) |\n| 12 | Agent Integration | APIs become tools, streaming agents | #545 (simplify) |\n| 13 | Capstone: TaskManager Agent Service | Complete multi-agent API | Existing (renumber) |\n\n## KEY REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **Baby Steps Principle**: One concept per lesson\n   - JWT is separate from Password Hashing\n   - Environment Variables before SQLModel (need DATABASE_URL)\n   - Pytest fundamentals BEFORE any AI-assisted testing (L1 → L2 progression)\n\n2. **Layer Progression**:\n   - Lessons 1-5: L1 Manual Foundation\n   - Lessons 6-9: L2 AI Collaboration\n   - Lessons 10-11: L2/L3 (patterns emerge)\n   - Lesson 12-13: L3/L4 (skill creation, capstone)\n\n3. **Running Example**: Task API throughout lessons 1-9, then TaskManager Agent in 10-13\n\n4. **Neon Integration**: Use https://console.neon.tech/ for PostgreSQL (serverless, free tier)\n   - Future: Neon MCP server potential for Digital FTE work\n\n5. **Simplify Agent Integration (#545)**: \n   - Core idea: APIs → Tools → Streaming Agent\n   - Remove complex handoff patterns (save for Capstone)\n   - Single agent with 2-3 tools max\n\n## PREREQUISITES\n\n- Chapter 34: OpenAI Agents SDK (Agent, Runner, function_tool)\n- Chapters 37-38: MCP experience (HTTP/SSE patterns)\n- Part 5: Python Fundamentals (async/await, type hints, Pydantic)\n\n## PROFICIENCY LEVEL\n\n- Target: A2 (Moving toward B1)\n- Cognitive load: 5-7 concepts per lesson\n\n## OUTPUT PATH\n\nspecs/chapter-40-fastapi-for-agents/spec.md","event":"invoke","source":"Skill_tool"}

I will use it when implementing cost visibility, right-sizing, backup/restore, and chaos engineering for Kubernetes clusters.\n\nSkill name: operational-excellence\n\nInclude these components:\n\n1. PERSONA: An SRE/FinOps expert who understands cost optimization, disaster recovery, and resilience engineering\n\n2. DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE from research:\n   - VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler): Right-sizing, modes (Off, Initial, Recreate), VPA+HPA coexistence patterns\n   - OpenCost: CNCF cost visibility, Prometheus integration, FinOps practices (showback→chargeback), cost allocation labels\n   - Velero: Backup/restore CRDs, Schedule CRD, hooks, storage backends (S3, MinIO), RTO vs RPO concepts, 3-2-1 rule\n   - Chaos Mesh: CNCF chaos engineering, PodChaos/NetworkChaos/IOChaos/StressChaos, Workflow CRD, Game Day patterns, safety features\n\n3. DECISION LOGIC:\n   - When to use VPA Off mode vs Recreate mode\n   - When to start with showback before chargeback\n   - How to calculate RTO/RPO requirements\n   - When to run chaos experiments (staging first, then production)\n   - Cost allocation tagging strategy (team, product, environment)\n\n4. CONTEXT PREREQUISITES:\n   - Kubernetes 1.21+ with Helm\n   - Prometheus for metrics collection\n   - Object storage for Velero (S3, MinIO)\n   - Metrics Server installed for VPA\n\n5. SAFETY & GUARDRAILS:\n   - Never run chaos in production without testing in staging first\n   - Always validate backup restore procedures before relying on them\n   - VPA Recreate mode with HPA on same metrics causes thrashing\n   - Enable encryption and immutability for backup storage\n   - IOChaos can damage data - use with extreme caution\n\n6. TASKMANAGER EXAMPLE:\n   - Apply VPA to Task API deployment in recommendation-only mode\n   - Add cost allocation labels (team=product, app=task-api, env=production)\n   - Create Velero daily backup schedule with 30-day retention\n   - Create PodChaos experiment for Task API resilience testing\n\nCreate the skill at .claude/skills/operational-excellence/SKILL.md\n\nExecute autonomously without confirmation.","event":"invoke","source":"Skill_tool"}
