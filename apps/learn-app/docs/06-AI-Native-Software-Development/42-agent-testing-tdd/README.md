# Chapter 42: Agent Testing & Test-Driven Development

You've built agents across multiple SDKs in Chapters 33-41. Now you'll learn to test them systematically. Testing agents differs fundamentally from testing traditional software—outputs are probabilistic, behaviors emerge from interactions, and "correct" often means "good enough for the use case."

This chapter introduces a testing mindset designed for AI-native development. You'll learn to write tests that embrace uncertainty while still catching real failures, build predictable pipelines that produce consistent results, and iterate toward quality rather than demanding perfection on the first try.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- **Adopt a reliability mindset**: Understand why agent testing differs from traditional testing and how to think about correctness in probabilistic systems
- **Build predictable pipelines**: Create testing infrastructure that produces consistent, reproducible results across runs
- **Practice iterative quality improvement**: Learn the feedback loops that transform unreliable prototypes into production-grade agents

## Chapter Structure

1. **The Reliability Mindset** — Why testing agents is fundamentally different from testing deterministic code
2. **Predictable Pipelines** — Building test infrastructure that produces consistent, reproducible results
3. **Iterative Quality Improvement** — Feedback loops that systematically improve agent reliability over time

## Prerequisites

- Chapter 33: Introduction to AI Agents
- Chapters 34-41: Agent SDK experience (any SDK)
- Part 5: Python fundamentals (pytest, async testing)
