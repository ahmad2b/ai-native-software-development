# Chapter 43: Evaluation Frameworks

Testing tells you if agents work. Evaluation tells you how well. This chapter moves beyond pass/fail testing to systematic measurement of agent quality, safety verification, and production readiness assessment.

You'll build evaluation frameworks that measure what matters for your domain—accuracy, latency, cost, safety compliance. You'll learn to treat safety as an architectural concern rather than an afterthought, manage production agent state, and verify deployments before releasing to users.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- **Implement evaluation-driven development**: Write evaluations before implementations to guide agent design toward measurable goals
- **Architect for safety**: Build safety constraints into agent systems rather than bolting them on after
- **Manage production state**: Handle agent memory, checkpoints, and state across deployments
- **Verify deployments**: Validate agents in production environments before full release

## Chapter Structure

1. **Evaluation-Driven Development** — Write evaluations first, let them guide agent implementation
2. **Safety as Architecture** — Build safety into the system design, not just the prompt
3. **Production State Management** — Handle agent memory, state, and persistence in production
4. **Deployment Verification** — Validate agents work correctly in production environments
5. **Capstone: Spec-Driven TaskManager** — Apply all evaluation techniques to a complete agent system

## Prerequisites

- Chapter 42: Agent Testing & TDD
- Chapters 34-41: Agent SDK experience
- Part 5: Python fundamentals
