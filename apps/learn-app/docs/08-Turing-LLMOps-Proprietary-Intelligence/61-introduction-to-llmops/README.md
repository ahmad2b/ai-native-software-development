# Chapter 61: Introduction to LLMOps

**Before you fine-tune anything, you need to know WHEN to fine-tune.**

This chapter establishes the strategic foundation for LLMOps—the discipline of training, deploying, and operating custom language models. You'll learn to distinguish between situations where prompt engineering suffices and where fine-tuning creates genuine value. By the end, you'll have a decision framework skill that guides all your future LLMOps work.

## The Strategic Arc

```
L1-L4: Build Mental Models
  │   └── LLMOps lifecycle, decision frameworks, training taxonomy, economics
  │
  ├── L5-L6: AI Collaboration
  │   └── Analyze your domain use cases with AI assistance
  │
  └── L7: Intelligence Design
      └── Create your llmops-decision-framework skill
```

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- **Explain the LLMOps lifecycle**: Data curation → Training → Evaluation → Deployment → Monitoring
- **Apply a decision framework**: Know when fine-tuning creates value vs. when prompt engineering is sufficient
- **Distinguish training approaches**: Pretraining vs. SFT vs. Alignment (DPO)
- **Calculate ROI**: Analyze costs, break-even points, and time-to-value for custom models
- **Create reusable intelligence**: Build an `llmops-decision-framework` skill for future projects

## Chapter Structure

| # | Lesson | Key Outcome |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | The LLMOps Revolution | Understand proprietary intelligence as competitive advantage |
| 2 | The LLM Lifecycle | Master the five-stage lifecycle and feedback loops |
| 3 | When to Fine-Tune (Decision Framework) | Apply decision tree for fine-tune vs. prompt |
| 4 | Training Taxonomy | Distinguish pretraining, SFT, and DPO |
| 5 | Economics of Custom Models | Calculate ROI and break-even analysis |
| 6 | Use Case Analysis with AI | Collaborate with AI to evaluate your domain |
| **7** | **Build Your LLMOps Decision Skill** | **Create reusable decision framework** |

## 4-Layer Teaching Progression

This chapter follows the **4-Layer Teaching Method**:

- **Lessons 1-5 (Layer 1)**: Build mental models manually—understand LLMOps strategy before AI assists
- **Lesson 6 (Layer 2)**: AI Collaboration—analyze your domain with Three Roles methodology
- **Lesson 7 (Layer 3)**: Create reusable intelligence that compounds across future projects

## Running Example: Task API Domain

Throughout Part 8, you'll apply LLMOps concepts to the **Task API** from Chapter 40:

- **This chapter**: Analyze whether a Task Management Assistant should be fine-tuned
- **Chapters 63-66**: Create training data, fine-tune, add persona, add tool-calling
- **Chapters 67-72**: Align, evaluate, deploy, and integrate with agent frameworks

The progression builds a complete **Digital FTE**—a deployable custom model that can be licensed or sold.

## Why This Chapter Matters

Fine-tuning is expensive—not in dollars (we'll keep it under $1), but in time and effort. Before you invest hours preparing data and training models, you need to know:

1. **Is this use case suitable for fine-tuning?** (Not every problem needs it)
2. **What type of fine-tuning?** (SFT for knowledge, persona tuning for style, DPO for safety)
3. **What's the expected ROI?** (Will the custom model pay for itself?)

This chapter gives you the strategic clarity to make those decisions confidently.

## Prerequisites

- **Parts 1-7 completion**: You understand agents, APIs, and cloud-native development
- **Chapter 40 Task API**: Familiarity with the running example
- **No ML experience required**: We start from first principles

## Looking Ahead

This chapter produces:
1. A **clear understanding** of when LLMOps creates value
2. An **llmops-decision-framework skill** for evaluating future projects

Chapter 62 dives into the technical foundations—transformer architecture, VRAM budgeting, and quantization—that make fine-tuning possible on consumer hardware.

**Total Duration**: ~5 hours (300 minutes)
