# Chapter 65: Identity & Persona Tuning

**Style tuning makes your model YOURS—not just another generic assistant.**

This chapter applies supervised fine-tuning specifically for persona characteristics. You'll learn to distinguish style tuning (how to communicate) from knowledge tuning (what to know), design persona datasets that enforce consistency, and create a Task API assistant with a distinctive, encouraging "TaskMaster" personality.

## The Persona Arc

```
L1-L2: Conceptual Foundation
  │   └── Style vs knowledge tuning, persona design
  │
  ├── L3-L6: Hands-on Persona Training
  │   └── Dataset creation, training, evaluation, multi-persona
  │
  └── L7: Capstone — TaskMaster Persona Bot
      └── Deploy distinctive Digital FTE
```

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- **Distinguish style vs. knowledge tuning**: When each approach applies
- **Design persona specifications**: Traits, vocabulary, response patterns
- **Create persona datasets**: Consistent voice across all examples
- **Fine-tune for persona**: Hyperparameters optimized for style transfer
- **Evaluate persona consistency**: Trait adherence scoring with LLM-as-Judge
- **Build multi-persona models**: Switch personalities via system prompt

## Chapter Structure

| # | Lesson | Key Outcome |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Style vs Knowledge Tuning | Understand when each applies |
| 2 | Persona Dataset Design | Create persona specification template |
| 3 | Creating Persona Datasets | Generate consistent training data |
| 4 | Persona Fine-Tuning | Train for style with optimized config |
| 5 | Persona Evaluation | Measure trait adherence |
| 6 | Multi-Persona Models | Switch personas via system prompt |
| **7** | **Capstone — TaskMaster Persona Bot** | **Distinctive Digital FTE** |

## 4-Layer Teaching Progression

This chapter follows the **4-Layer Teaching Method**:

- **Lessons 1-2 (Layer 1)**: Build mental models—understand persona design
- **Lessons 3-6 (Layer 2)**: Hands-on with AI collaboration
- **Lesson 7 (Layer 4)**: Spec-driven capstone—produce deployable Digital FTE

## Style vs. Knowledge Tuning

| Aspect | Style Tuning | Knowledge Tuning |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Focus | How to communicate | What to communicate |
| Examples | Formal/casual, friendly/professional | Domain terminology, procedures |
| Data needed | 100-500 examples | 500-5000 examples |
| Use case | Brand voice, persona | Expert assistant |

## TaskMaster Persona Specification

```markdown
# Persona: TaskMaster

## Core Traits
- Encouraging: "Great job on completing that task!"
- Productivity-focused: Always suggests efficiency improvements
- Professional but friendly: Business casual tone
- Action-oriented: Focuses on next steps

## Vocabulary
- "Let's get this done"
- "You're making great progress"
- "Here's a tip to work smarter"

## Response Patterns
- Start with acknowledgment
- Provide action confirmation
- End with encouragement or next suggestion

## What NOT to do
- Never be condescending
- Never use excessive emojis
- Never give generic responses
```

## Running Example: TaskMaster Assistant

You'll create a Task API assistant with distinctive personality:

**Before (Generic)**:
> Task created successfully.

**After (TaskMaster)**:
> Great choice! I've created "Review Q4 budget" with high priority due Friday. You're staying on top of things—this is exactly the kind of proactive planning that leads to success. Want me to set a reminder for Thursday?

## Prerequisites

- **Chapter 64 completion**: You have a fine-tuned Task API base model
- **Chapter 63 dataset**: Base training data to augment with persona
- **OpenAI API access**: For persona data generation (optional)

## Looking Ahead

This chapter produces:
1. A **TaskMaster Persona Bot** with distinctive voice
2. **Persona design patterns** transferable to any domain
3. **Multi-persona capability** for product variations

Chapter 66 adds tool-calling capabilities, making your model suitable as an agent backend.

**Total Duration**: ~5.5 hours (330 minutes)
