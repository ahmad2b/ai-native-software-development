# Part 3: Markdown & Context Engineering

You're no longer just writing code—you're directing intelligent agents like Claude Code to implement what you specify. The developers who thrive in this new era aren't those who type the fastest, but those who communicate most clearly with their AI partners. Two foundational skills—markdown formatting and context engineering—determine whether AI helps you build faster or slows you down with buggy, generic code.

## What You'll Learn

### Chapter 11: Markdown - The Language of AI Communication

**What it is:** Markdown is a simple way to format text using plain characters. AI agents love it because it's structured and easy to read.

**Why it matters:** AI agents "think" in Markdown. When you format your specifications, documentation, and prompts using Markdown, AI understands your intent better and generates higher-quality code. Every major AI tool (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) uses Markdown as its native format. Learning Markdown isn't just about formatting—it's about speaking the AI's language.

### Chapter 12: Context Engineering for AI-Driven Development

**What it is:** Context engineering is the discipline of curating what goes into the AI's working memory—the files loaded, prompts written, patterns established, and decisions persisted across sessions.

**Why it matters:** As Andrej Karpathy notes, "Context engineering is the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM." Prompting is just one component of context engineering. Without proper context management, AI generates code that might work in isolation but breaks when integrated. With context engineering mastery, AI maintains consistency across sessions, remembers your architectural decisions, and generates code that matches your existing patterns.

**The connection:** Markdown is **the format** AI uses to structure information. Context engineering encompasses **everything your AI agent knows**—including your prompts, loaded files, memory files, and session history. Together, they form your complete AI collaboration skillset.

From here on, every chapter in this book uses AI collaboration as the default workflow. You'll write specifications in Markdown and engineer context effectively.

The shift starts now: from passive reader to active AI orchestrator.
