# Chapter 12: AI Fluency Basics - Prompt & Context Engineering

You can use AI tools. But can you use them *fluently*?

The difference matters enormously. A tourist can order coffee in Paris with a phrasebook. A fluent speaker negotiates complex business deals. Both "use French"—but one creates dramatically more value.

AI Fluency is the professional skill that separates developers who occasionally get useful outputs from those who consistently produce production-quality results. This chapter teaches you that skill through the **4D Framework**: **Delegation, Description, Discernment, and Diligence**—principles that work across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and any AI system you'll encounter.

## The 4D Framework

```
Delegation → Description → Discernment → Diligence
```

**Delegation**: Deciding what AI should do (and what it shouldn't)
**Description**: Communicating your intent with precision
**Discernment**: Evaluating and refining AI outputs iteratively
**Diligence**: Ensuring responsible, accurate, and ethical AI use

These aren't separate skills—they're a workflow. Master the 4Ds, and you'll consistently produce professional results with AI collaboration.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this chapter, you will:

- **Define AI Fluency** as a measurable professional skill distinct from basic AI tool usage
- **Apply the Delegation framework** to decide which tasks AI should handle and how
- **Structure prompts effectively** using Anthropic's 6 prompting techniques
- **Manage context windows** to maintain AI focus and quality across sessions
- **Execute the Description-Discernment loop** for iterative refinement
- **Recognize degradation symptoms** and know when to restart or compress sessions
- **Practice Diligence** in creation, transparency, and deployment of AI-assisted work
- **Orchestrate complete workflows** combining all 4Ds in real projects

## Key Insight

> "Context engineering is the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM."
> — Andrej Karpathy

Prompt engineering is just one piece of context engineering. This chapter teaches you the complete picture: not just *what to say*, but *what your AI knows* when you say it, *how to evaluate* what it produces, and *how to be responsible* about the results.

**The shift**: From "using AI tools" to "AI Fluency"—a professional skill that compounds over time.
