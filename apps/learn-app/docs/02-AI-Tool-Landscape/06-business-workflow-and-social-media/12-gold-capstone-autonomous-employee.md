# Gold Capstone: Full Autonomous Employee

:::info Gold Tier Capstone
This is the **Gold Tier capstone** — optional but impressive. Complete Silver Tier (L08-L11) first.
:::

## Coming Soon

This lesson will guide you to integrate everything into a **production-ready Personal AI Employee** that operates autonomously 24/7.

**What You'll Build:**
- Cross-domain integration (Email + Files + optional extension)
- Error recovery with retry logic and graceful degradation
- Comprehensive audit logging (JSON format, 90-day retention)
- Full architecture documentation

**Key Concept:** A Gold Tier employee isn't just capable — it's reliable, auditable, and documented.

## Gold Tier Deliverables

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Multi-Domain** | At least 2 domains integrated |
| **Error Recovery** | Exponential backoff, graceful degradation |
| **Audit Logging** | JSON logs in `/Logs/`, 90-day retention |
| **Documentation** | README with architecture and lessons learned |
