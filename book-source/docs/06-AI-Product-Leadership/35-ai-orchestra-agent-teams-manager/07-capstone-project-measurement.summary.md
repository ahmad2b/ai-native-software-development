### Core Concept
Build a real 3-feature system in parallel, measure speedup (target: 2-3x), document decomposition thinking, and articulate the pattern as a portfolio narrative demonstrating strategic orchestration capability to employers.

### Key Mental Models
- **Metrics as Proof**: Time tracking (sequential vs. parallel), merge conflict count, and test coverage changes quantify decomposition quality and orchestration effectiveness
- **Portfolio Narrative Strategy**: Emphasize decomposition thinking and team coordination capability over tools; employers value orchestration patterns that scale from 3 agents to human teams
- **Scaling Pathway Understanding**: 3 features (manual coordination), 5-7 features (contracts + hooks), 10+ features (orchestration automation) represents progression from prototype to production-scale coordination

### Critical Patterns
- **Choice Between Projects**: Task Management (CRUD foundation + 2 independent enhancements) or Agent UI (CLI connector foundation + 2 independent visualization layers) both provide genuine parallelizability
- **Time Tracking Validation**: Sequential baseline (375 min) vs. parallel actual establishes concrete speedup metrics; imbalanced features or excessive merge conflicts explain speedup &lt;2x
- **Documentation for Scale**: README captures decomposition approach, time metrics, merge conflict analysis, and lessons learned—artifacts that demonstrate thinking beyond "I coded faster"

### AI Collaboration Keys
- AI can execute full workflow (spec → plan → tasks → implement) autonomously across 3 parallel sessions when given clear decomposition upfront
- AI helps articulate portfolio narrative emphasizing orchestration capability and scaling patterns
- AI analyzes capstone metrics to extract lessons about what decomposition patterns scale and what breaks

### Common Mistakes
- Choosing non-parallelizable features (Feature 2 and 3 both heavily depend on each other) ruining the capstone experiment
- Focusing portfolio narrative on tools (git worktrees, terminal management) instead of strategic capability (decomposition thinking, team coordination)
- Not documenting decomposition thinking and scaling lessons—just measuring time without extracting the insight

### Connections
- **Builds on**: All previous lessons (Lessons 1-6), full orchestration workflow, contract-based coordination
- **Extension pathway**: 5-feature system (Lessons 1-6 at larger scale), validates that patterns scale beyond 3 agents
