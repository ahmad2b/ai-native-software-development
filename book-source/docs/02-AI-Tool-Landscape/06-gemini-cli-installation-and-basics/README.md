# Chapter 6: Gemini CLI: Your Second AI Learning Companion

In Chapter 5, you learned Claude Code—your first AI companion in the terminal.

Now you're ready to meet **Gemini CLI**, Google's AI companion tool. And here's the interesting part: it's similar to Claude Code in many ways, but with important differences that might make it the better choice for your situation.

This chapter teaches you:
- What Gemini CLI is and why you might choose it
- How to install it and start learning with it
- How to save your conversations and keep learning organized
- How to customize it to match your learning style
- How to extend it with special powers

By the end, you'll have two powerful AI tools at your command, and you'll understand when to use each one.

## Key Principle: You Don't Have to Use It All

Gemini CLI has many advanced features. **You don't have to learn or use them all.**

This chapter teaches you the core features that beginners actually use:
- Asking questions
- Saving conversations
- Creating preferences files
- Continuing learning

Advanced features (custom commands, MCP servers, advanced workflows) exist but aren't required.

## A Quick Note on "Terminal" and "Commands"

If you're worried about the terminal, don't be. We covered this in Chapter 5, but here's the simple version:

- **Terminal:** A text window where you type instructions
- **Command:** An instruction you type (like "gemini" to start Gemini CLI)
- **Slash command:** A special command that starts with `/` to control your session (like "/help")

Chapter 5 taught you the basics. This chapter builds on that.

## Common Questions Before You Start

**Q: Do I need to use Gemini CLI if I already know Claude Code?**

A: No. But learning it gives you options. You'll understand when each tool is better.

**Q: Is Gemini CLI harder than Claude Code?**

A: No. It's very similar. Many concepts are identical. If you completed Chapter 5, you're ready.

**Q: Will this take a long time?**

A: About 2 hours total for all lessons. But you can go slower if you need to.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**

A: Ask Gemini! That's literally what it's for. "I'm confused about [thing]. Help?"
