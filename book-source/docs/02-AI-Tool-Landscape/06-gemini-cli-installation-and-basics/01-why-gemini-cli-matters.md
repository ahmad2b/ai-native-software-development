# Your Second AI Learning Companion (Gemini CLI)

In Chapter 5, you met Claude Code—an AI companion in your terminal. You learned that having an AI assistant *right where you work* is more powerful than opening a separate browser tab.

Now you're about to meet Gemini CLI—Google's answer to Claude Code. And here's the interesting part: **the two tools are more similar than different, but they have strengths in different situations.**

This lesson isn't about choosing one tool to abandon the other. It's about understanding when each tool shines, so you can pick the best one for what you're trying to learn *right now*.

---

## What is Gemini CLI? (Start Here If New)

**Gemini CLI is another AI tool that lives in your terminal—very similar to Claude Code.**

Like Claude Code, Gemini CLI:
- Answers your questions through text commands
- Remembers what you've talked about
- Explains things in simple language
- Can see the files on your computer
- Helps you learn at your own pace

**The main difference:** Gemini CLI is made by Google (Gemini is Google's AI), while Claude Code is made by Anthropic (Claude is their AI).

Both are free to try. Both live in your terminal. Both can help you learn.

---

## Why "Another" AI Tool? Don't You Already Have Claude Code?

Great question. You might be thinking: "I just learned Claude Code. Why do I need another one?"

Here's the honest answer: **You probably don't need both tools right now.** But as you grow as a learner, there will be situations where Gemini CLI is the *better choice* for your specific goal.

Think of it like having two routes to the same destination:
- **Route A (Claude Code)**: Direct highway, good for most trips
- **Route B (Gemini CLI)**: Scenic road with interesting stops, good for different kinds of trips

Eventually, you might use both depending on where you're going.

## Three Key Differences Between Claude Code and Gemini CLI

### Difference 1: Cost and Accessibility

**Claude Code** works, but if you want to use it a lot, you need to pay money. Think of it like a paid coffee subscription—you get quality, but there's a cost.

**Gemini CLI** offers a free tier that's actually quite generous:
- You can ask 60 questions per minute
- You can ask 1,000 questions per day
- You don't need to pay anything upfront
- Just need a Google account (most people have one)

**Why this matters for learners:**
If you're trying to learn by asking lots of questions, Gemini CLI lets you experiment freely without worrying about the bill. That freedom to explore is valuable when you're learning.

---

### Difference 2: How Much Information It Can "Remember" at Once

Imagine two friends helping you with homework:
- **Friend A (Claude Code)** can read about 500 pages of your notes at one time
- **Friend B (Gemini CLI)** can read about 2,500 pages of your notes at one time

**Why this matters:** If you're working on a big project with lots of files, Gemini CLI can look at more of your work at the same time. This means fewer explanations like "let me remind you what we discussed on page 100."

---

### Difference 3: It's "Open Source" (You Can Look Inside)

**What does "open source" mean?**

Think of it like a recipe:
- **Closed recipe** (Claude Code): "Trust us, our dish tastes great." You can't see the ingredients or method—you just use what we give you.
- **Open recipe** (Gemini CLI): "Here's every ingredient, every step, and every secret technique. Change it if you want."

**Why this matters for learners:**
If you're curious about *how* the tool works, Gemini CLI lets you look at the actual code. You can understand the decisions behind it. You can even modify it if you want (with help from teachers or AI companions).

This is especially valuable for learning, because **understanding how tools work teaches you more than just using them.**

---

## When Should You Use Gemini CLI Instead of Claude Code?

Let's look at four real situations where Gemini CLI is the better choice:

### Situation 1: You Want to Learn for Free, Lots of Questions

**Your scenario:**
- You're in school and don't have money for paid tools
- You have questions constantly (that's how learning happens!)
- You want to experiment without worrying about costs

**Why Gemini CLI wins:**
Free tier means you can ask 1,000 questions per day without paying a cent. Over a semester, that's the difference between $450+ in costs (Claude Code) and $0 (Gemini CLI).

**Example conversation:**
```
You: I don't understand file permissions. What does "read" mean?
Gemini: A file permission called "read" means...
[several minutes later]

You: But what about "write"?
Gemini: "Write" is different. It means...
[later that day]

You: Can I combine them somehow?
Gemini: Yes, you can combine permissions...
```

You asked three questions freely. With Claude Code, you'd be thinking about cost. With Gemini CLI, you just learn.

---

### Situation 2: You're Working on a Big Project with Many Files

**Your scenario:**
- You're learning by working on a project
- The project has 50, 100, or 200 files
- You want the AI to understand the whole picture at once

**Why Gemini CLI wins:**
Its larger memory (2,500 pages vs. 500 pages) means it can read all your files in one conversation. Claude Code would require you to upload files in chunks.

**Example scenario:**
```
You: I want to understand my entire project structure

Claude Code: I can read 500 pages of your code. That covers about 40% of your files.

Gemini CLI: I can read 2,500 pages of your code. That covers your entire project.
```

This matters because understanding the *whole* project is easier than understanding pieces separately.

---

### Situation 3: You Want to Understand How Tools Work (Open Source)

**Your scenario:**
- You're curious about *how* the AI tool makes decisions
- You want to see the actual code
- You might want to modify how it works

**Why Gemini CLI wins:**
Open source means you can read the actual code and understand exactly how it works. This is powerful for learning, because **understanding the tool teaches you more than just using it.**

**Example learning path:**
```
Level 1: Use Gemini CLI to answer questions
Level 2: Look at Gemini CLI's actual code (it's available online)
Level 3: Understand why it makes certain decisions
Level 4: Modify it for your specific learning needs
```

Claude Code doesn't offer this transparency—it's a "black box" you use without seeing inside.

---

### Situation 4: You Want to Connect It to Your Own Tools

**Your scenario:**
- You use specific tools your school provides (a database, a wiki, etc.)
- You want Gemini CLI to connect to those tools
- You want to customize how it works with your tools

**Why Gemini CLI wins:**
Open source means you (or someone helping you) can build custom connections. This is called "MCP servers"—we'll learn about this in a later lesson.

**Example:**
```
Your school has a database with your assignments.
You want Gemini CLI to look at that database while helping you learn.

With Claude Code: Not possible (closed system)
With Gemini CLI: You (or your teacher) can build a custom connection
```

---

## Three Ways They're Actually the Same

Before you think Gemini CLI is completely different, here's what's actually *the same*:

### 1. Both Live in Your Terminal

Both tools use the terminal (that text window you learned about in Chapter 5). You type questions, they answer. Same interface.

### 2. Both Can See Your Files and Folders

Both tools can look at the files on your computer and understand your project structure. This is more powerful than web-based AI tools.

### 3. Both Remember Your Conversation

Both tools remember what you've discussed, so you don't have to re-explain yourself every time.

## Choosing Your First Tool: A Decision Framework

Here's a simple way to decide which tool to try first:

**Use Gemini CLI if:**
- ✅ You're on a tight budget (free tier is important)
- ✅ You like exploring and trying lots of things
- ✅ You want to understand how the tool works
- ✅ You're working on bigger projects

**Use Claude Code if:**
- ✅ You've already started with Claude Code in Chapter 5 (stick with it—no need to switch)
- ✅ You like web-based tools better than terminal
- ✅ You want something you don't have to set up

**The real answer:** **Start with Claude Code if you finished Chapter 5, or start with Gemini CLI if you haven't and want something free.**

You can always try both. They're both tools for learning—there's no wrong choice.

---

## Common Misconceptions (Let's Clear These Up)

### Misconception 1: "Isn't Gemini CLI just a copy of Claude Code?"

**Reality:** No, they're separate tools made by different companies (Google vs Anthropic). They happen to solve similar problems in similar ways, but they're independent tools.

Think of it like iPhone and Android—similar tools, different makers, different choices inside.

---

### Misconception 2: "If I learn Claude Code, I won't know how to use Gemini CLI"

**Reality:** Once you understand *one* AI learning companion, learning another takes 30 minutes. The skills transfer completely—you already know how to ask questions, how conversations work, how to describe what you want.

The only difference is a few different commands, which you can learn in Lesson 2.

---

### Misconception 3: "Open source means I have to understand the code"

**Reality:** No. Open source just means the code is *available* if you want to look. You don't have to understand it to use the tool. Most people use Gemini CLI without ever looking at the code.

Think of it like having a book in a library—the book is there, but you don't have to read it unless you're curious.

---

## Pause and Reflect: Which Tool Calls to You?

Before we move to installation, think about this:

**Which description sounds more like YOU?**

**Option A:** "I've already learned Claude Code in Chapter 5. I want to deepen my skills with the same tool."

**Option B:** "I haven't learned Claude Code yet, or I'm curious about trying Gemini CLI. I like free tools and want to explore."

**Option C:** "I'm curious about BOTH. I want to learn what each one does."

Write this down mentally. Your answer helps determine which lesson path makes sense for you next.

---

## What You're Actually Learning (Beyond Just Another Tool)

Here's what this lesson teaches that goes beyond "Gemini CLI":

**Skill 1: How to Choose Tools**
You're learning that tool selection isn't about brand preference—it's about matching the right tool to your specific situation.

**Skill 2: Understanding Different Approaches**
Closed (Claude Code) vs. Open (Gemini CLI). Different philosophy, different strengths.

**Skill 3: Recognizing When to Switch**
Sometimes your first choice is right for months. Sometimes after a week, you realize a different tool works better. Both are normal.

---

## Try With AI: Tool Preference Discovery

Use ChatGPT, Gemini, or any web-based AI tool for this exercise. You're not trying the tools yet—you're thinking about which one might fit you better.

### Prompt 1: Personal Learning Style

```
I'm learning AI development tools. I need to choose between Claude Code and Gemini CLI.
Tell me: If you didn't know anything about either tool, what questions would YOU ask to figure
out which one matches MY learning style better? (Generate 3-5 questions)
```

**What you learn:** The right questions to ask when choosing tools.

---

### Prompt 2: Your Specific Situation

```
Now answer your own questions from the previous prompt, thinking about YOUR situation.
(Example: "Do I have a budget? Yes/No. Do I want to understand how tools work? Yes/No.")

Based on your answers, which tool sounds like a better match? Why?
```

**What you learn:** How to apply a decision framework to your own situation.

---

### Safety Note

Remember: Both are real tools made by real companies (Google and Anthropic). Both are legitimate choices. This isn't about convincing you to use one—it's about understanding that different tools serve different needs.

Your teachers and AI companions can help you switch later if needed. There's no permanent commitment.

---

## What's Next: From Understanding to Installing

In Lesson 2, you'll install Gemini CLI (or continue with Claude Code) and have your first real conversation.

**Before moving on**, make sure you understand:
- ✅ Gemini CLI is similar to Claude Code (both in terminal)
- ✅ They have different strengths in different situations
- ✅ You might use one or both, depending on your needs
- ✅ You can always try both without commitment

---

## Key Terms Review

**Terminal:** The text window where you type commands (same as in Chapter 5).

**Gemini CLI:** Google's AI companion tool that lives in your terminal.

**Claude Code:** Anthropic's AI companion tool that lives in your terminal (you learned about this in Chapter 5).

**Free tier:** A version of a tool you can use without paying money, with some limits (fewer questions per day, for example).

**Open source:** Software where the code is publicly available for anyone to read and modify. Like a recipe that's public instead of secret.

**Context window:** How much information the AI can remember at once. Bigger = it can read more of your files in one conversation.

---

**Ready for Lesson 2?** Next, you'll install Gemini CLI (or make a final choice between Claude Code and Gemini CLI) and start learning.
