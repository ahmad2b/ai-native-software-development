# Ship + Retrospective

Your four features are built. Your skills are created. Now verify everything is complete, document what you learned, and ship.

## Verify Your System

Check that all outputs exist and meet quality standards.

### Output Files Verification

```bash
ls specs/*/output/
```

**Expected files:**
- `specs/brand-profiler/output/f1-brand-analysis.md`
- `specs/market-scanner/output/f2-market-brief.md`
- `specs/content-strategy/output/f3-content-strategy.md`
- `specs/action-dashboard/output/f4-action-dashboard.md`

**Missing any files?** Go back and complete that feature.

### SDD-RI Artifacts Verification

```bash
ls specs/*/
```

**Each feature should have:**
- `spec.md` — Feature specification (created by /sp.specify)
- `plan.md` — Implementation plan (created by /sp.plan)
- `tasks.md` — Atomic tasks with checkpoints (created by /sp.tasks)
- `output/` — Validated output (created by /sp.implement)

### Quality Gate Verification

For each output, verify it meets the constitution's quality gates:

**F1: Brand Analysis**
```bash
cat specs/brand-profiler/output/f1-brand-analysis.md | head -40
```

Checklist:
- [ ] 3+ core strengths with evidence citations?
- [ ] 2+ brand gaps identified?
- [ ] Positioning statement (1-2 sentences)?
- [ ] Differentiation opportunities?
- [ ] Confidence score?

**F2: Market Brief**
```bash
cat specs/market-scanner/output/f2-market-brief.md | head -40
```

Checklist:
- [ ] 3+ industry trends?
- [ ] In-demand skills list?
- [ ] Competitor/peer landscape?
- [ ] Opportunity areas matched to your profile?
- [ ] 3+ source citations?

**F3: Content Strategy**
```bash
cat specs/content-strategy/output/f3-content-strategy.md | head -40
```

Checklist:
- [ ] 3 content pillars?
- [ ] Each pillar connects F1 strength to F2 trend?
- [ ] 10+ topic ideas?
- [ ] Weekly posting schedule?
- [ ] First week action items?

**F4: Action Dashboard**
```bash
cat specs/action-dashboard/output/f4-action-dashboard.md | head -40
```

Checklist:
- [ ] Brand summary from F1?
- [ ] Market opportunities from F2?
- [ ] Content calendar from F3?
- [ ] Top 5 priority actions?
- [ ] 30/60/90 day goals?
- [ ] No redundancy across sections?

**If any check fails:** Go back to the relevant feature and fix it before proceeding.

### Supporting Files Verification

```bash
ls -la
```

**Expected files:**
- `TIME_TRACKER.md` — Acceleration measurement
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — Quality standards (created by /sp.constitution)

### Skills Verification

```bash
ls .claude/skills/
```

**Expected files:**
- `sdd-ri-specification.md`
- `checkpoint-implementation.md`
- (optional third skill)

## Complete Your Acceleration Data

Open `TIME_TRACKER.md` and fill in any missing data:

```bash
cat TIME_TRACKER.md
```

**Required data:**

| Feature | Duration | % of F1 |
|---------|----------|---------|
| F1 | _____ min | 100% (baseline) |
| F2 | _____ min | _____% |
| F3 | _____ min | _____% |
| F4 | _____ min | _____% |

**Calculate your acceleration:**

```
F4 as % of F1 = (F4 duration / F1 duration) × 100

Example:
- F1 = 60 minutes
- F4 = 25 minutes
- F4 as % of F1 = (25 / 60) × 100 = 42%
- Result: F4 took 42% of F1 time (target was ≤ 50%)
```

**Did you achieve the target?**

| Result | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| **F4 < 50% of F1** | Target achieved. Intelligence accumulation proven. |
| **F4 = 50-66% of F1** | Good acceleration. Patterns transferred well. |
| **F4 = 66-80% of F1** | Moderate acceleration. Some overhead remained. |
| **F4 > 80% of F1** | Limited acceleration. Analyze what didn't transfer. |

## Write Your Retrospective

Create the retrospective file:

```bash
touch RETROSPECTIVE.md
```

Copy this template and fill it in:

```markdown
# Personal BI System Retrospective

## Acceleration Results

- **F1 baseline:** _____ minutes
- **F4 actual:** _____ minutes
- **F4 as % of F1:** _____% (target: ≤ 50%)
- **Target achieved:** YES / NO

## What Accelerated Development?

List specific patterns that made F2-F4 faster than F1:

### Pattern 1: _______________________
- **Where used:** Features ___, ___, ___
- **Why it accelerated:** _______________________
- **Example:** _______________________

### Pattern 2: _______________________

```

**Save the file.**

## Project Summary

Create a summary file that captures your complete system:

```bash
touch PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
```

```markdown
# Personal AI Business Intelligence System

## What This Is

A 4-feature personal intelligence system built entirely with AI tools (Gemini App, NotebookLM). No code written—just structured prompting, validation, and synthesis.

## Features

| Feature | Tool | Input | Output |
|---------|------|-------|--------|
| F1: Brand Profiler | Gemini App | Your profile data | Brand analysis |
| F2: Market Scanner | NotebookLM | Target company research | Market brief |
| F3: Content Strategy | Gemini App | F1 + F2 outputs | Content plan |
| F4: Action Dashboard | Gemini App | F1 + F2 + F3 outputs | Unified action plan |

## Outputs Produced

```
outputs/
├── f1-brand-analysis.md    # Your strengths, gaps, positioning
├── f2-market-brief.md      # Trends, skills, opportunities
├── f3-content-strategy.md  # Pillars, topics, schedule
└── f4-action-dashboard.md  # Unified dashboard + actions
```

## Intelligence Accumulation Proof

| Feature | Duration | % of F1 |
|---------|----------|---------|
| F1 | [your time] | 100% |
| F4 | [your time] | [your %] |

**F4 built in [X]% of F1 time.** Patterns from F1 (structured prompting, validation, quality gates) transferred directly to F2-F4.

## Skills Created

1. **SDD-RI Specification Design** — How to write /sp.specify specifications with Intent, Constraints, Success Evals
2. **Checkpoint-Driven Implementation** — How to use /sp.implement checkpoints for systematic validation

## Key Learning

[Your one-sentence insight from retrospective]

## How to Reuse This Approach

1. Start with **constitution** defining quality gates
2. Build **F1 slowly** — establish patterns
3. Build **F2-F4 faster** — reuse patterns
4. **Track time** — prove accumulation
5. **Create skills** — encode learnings
```

## Try With AI

Get final feedback on your project:

**Prompt 1: Retrospective Analysis**

In Gemini App:

```
Review my retrospective from a Personal BI System project:

[Paste your RETROSPECTIVE.md content]

Questions:
1. Based on my acceleration data, what specific patterns drove the most time savings?
2. For the friction points I identified, what would you recommend doing differently?
3. Am I missing any key insight about why F4 was [faster/slower] than expected?
4. What question should I add to my retrospective that would help me learn more?
```

**Prompt 2: Next Project Planning**

```
I just completed a Personal BI System with these results:
- F4 took [X]% of F1 time
- Used SDD-RI workflow (/sp.specify → /sp.plan → /sp.tasks → /sp.implement) for all 4 features
- Created 2 skills: SDD-RI Specification Design, Checkpoint-Driven Implementation
- Key learning: [your insight]

I want to build a similar system for [new domain: job applications / research papers / etc.]

Questions:
1. Which of my skills would transfer directly?
2. What new skill would I need for this domain?
3. How should I adapt my constitution for this new use case?
4. What's my target acceleration for this second project? (Should I expect even better than 50%?)
```
