D) Feature 1 output is needed for error handling

---

### Question 5

What is the correct sequence of commands in the SDD-RI workflow for building a feature?

A) /sp.plan → /sp.specify → /sp.implement → /sp.tasks
B) /sp.specify → /sp.plan → /sp.tasks → /sp.implement
C) /sp.constitution → /sp.specify → /sp.implement → /sp.plan
D) /sp.tasks → /sp.plan → /sp.specify → /sp.implement

---

### Question 6

A) "The feature should work well and produce useful output"
B) "Users will find the brand analysis helpful"
C) "Must cite specific phrases from your profile as evidence for each strength"
D) "Analysis will take less than an hour to complete"

---

### Question 7

A) Feature 4 requires simpler AI prompts
B) The constitution is no longer needed by Feature 4
C) Patterns from F1-F3 (structured prompting, validation, quality gates) transfer directly, reducing cognitive load
D) Feature 4 uses a different AI tool that is faster

---

### Question 8

True or False: Skills created using P+Q+P should be specific to a single project and should not be reused in other contexts.

---

### Question 9

In the Personal BI System, what is the primary purpose of the Action Dashboard (Feature 4)?

A) To generate new brand analysis data
B) To aggregate outputs from all upstream features (F1 + F2 + F3) into a unified view with priority actions
C) To replace the market intelligence brief
D) To automatically post content to social media

---

### Question 10

What is the primary purpose of checkpoints in /sp.implement?

A) To slow down the workflow for quality control
B) To pause at phase boundaries for human review before proceeding
C) To automatically save progress to git
D) To generate documentation for the feature

---

### Question 11

Which of the following represents a constitution principle being applied effectively across the Personal BI features?

A) Each feature interprets output format differently based on its unique context
B) Feature 1 outputs plain text, Feature 2 outputs JSON, Feature 3 outputs CSV—maximum flexibility
C) All features output structured markdown, ensuring upstream outputs can be validated against quality gates consistently
D) Each feature includes its own documentation format to suit its specific purpose

---

### Question 12

What should an honest retrospective document capture about feature development?

A) Only successful implementations and positive outcomes
B) Which AI tools performed best and which should be avoided
C) Specific patterns that accelerated development, friction points encountered, and learnings transferable to future projects
D) Timelines and resource plans for the next project

---

### Question 13 (Short Answer)

Explain in 2-3 sentences why the constitution is created BEFORE any features are built, and how this differs from documenting quality standards after the project is complete.

---

### Question 14 (Short Answer)

You've built Features 1-4 and identified a recurring pattern: "structured AI prompting with explicit output format and validation." This pattern appears with 5+ decision points (output format, input context, quality gates, examples, iteration approach). Should you formalize this as a reusable skill? Explain your reasoning using the 2+ features + 5+ decision points criteria.

## Answers

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answers</summary>

**1. B** - To establish quality gates and decision standards that apply consistently across all features. The constitution defines what "good" looks like before you start building, preventing quality drift and ensuring each feature meets the same standards.

**2. B** - Feature 4 should take approximately 50% of the time required for Feature 1. This 50% target demonstrates that accumulated patterns, reusable workflows, and intelligence compound—each subsequent feature builds faster due to prior work.

**3. True** - NotebookLM is specifically chosen for Feature 2 because it excels at uploading multiple sources (company pages, job postings, articles) and synthesizing insights with citations. This is different from Gemini App which is better for single-context analysis and generation.

**4. B** - Content pillars must connect personal strengths (F1) to market trends (F2), requiring both inputs. This is the pipeline architecture principle—Feature 3 synthesizes two upstream outputs to create content strategy that bridges personal brand and market opportunity.

**5. B** - /sp.specify → /sp.plan → /sp.tasks → /sp.implement. This is the core SDD-RI workflow:
- **/sp.specify** creates the feature specification (Intent, Constraints, Success Evals)
- **/sp.plan** generates the implementation plan from the specification
- **/sp.tasks** breaks the plan into atomic tasks with checkpoints
- **/sp.implement** executes the tasks with human review at each checkpoint

**6. C** - "Must cite specific phrases from your profile as evidence for each strength." Quality gates must be measurable and testable—not subjective statements like "work well" or "be helpful." This gate can be verified by checking if each strength includes a quoted phrase.

**7. C** - Patterns from F1-F3 (structured prompting, validation, quality gates) transfer directly, reducing cognitive load. Intelligence accumulation means you're not re-solving similar problems from scratch; you inherit proven approaches and can focus on Feature 4's unique aggregation task.

**8. False** - Skills should be designed for reuse across multiple projects and domains. The entire value of formalizing a pattern using the P+Q+P framework (Persona, Questions, Principles) is to make it applicable beyond the immediate context. This is why the pattern must recur in 2+ contexts and have 5+ decision points—criteria that ensure general applicability.

**9. B** - To aggregate outputs from all upstream features (F1 + F2 + F3) into a unified view with priority actions. The dashboard serves as the final integration point that makes the entire personal BI pipeline actionable—combining brand summary, market opportunities, content calendar, and synthesized actions.

**10. B** - To pause at phase boundaries for human review before proceeding. Checkpoints are the core mechanism of /sp.implement that ensures quality at every phase:
- The agent reports what was done
- Presents options (✅ Proceed or ❌ Fix issue)
- Waits for human decision before continuing
- This prevents errors from propagating through the workflow

**11. C** - All features output structured markdown, ensuring upstream outputs can be validated against quality gates consistently. This demonstrates the constitution principle of "Structured Outputs" being applied uniformly. It enables composition: F1 output becomes F3 input, F2 output becomes F3 input, all three become F4 input.

**12. C** - Specific patterns that accelerated development, friction points encountered, and learnings transferable to future projects. Honest retrospectives balance celebrating successes with capturing honest feedback about what worked, what didn't, and what you learned. This honesty is how intelligence accumulates—you capture not just wins but friction points that future projects should anticipate.

**13. Sample Answer:** The constitution is created BEFORE features to establish quality gates upfront, ensuring every feature is built to the same standard. This differs from post-project documentation because it guides decisions during development—you reference the constitution when validating outputs, not write it after the fact when standards may have drifted. Pre-defining quality prevents "good enough" compromises during implementation.

**14. Sample Answer:** Yes, formalize this as a reusable skill. The pattern appears in Features 1, 2, 3, and 4 (4 features exceeds the 2+ threshold), and the 5+ decision points (output format, input context, quality gates, examples, iteration approach) exceed the complexity threshold. This pattern has sufficient generality—it applies whenever you need structured output from an AI tool—making it valuable for future projects beyond Personal BI.
