# Chapter 15: Personal AI Business Intelligence Capstone

You've learned specification-driven development (Chapter 13) and practiced SDD-RI workflows with video generation (Chapter 14). Now you'll prove those skills compound by building a **Personal AI Business Intelligence System**—and measuring how much faster each feature builds.

This chapter has one core hypothesis: **Feature 4 should take less than half the time of Feature 1**. The skills, patterns, and specifications you create for Feature 1 will accelerate everything that follows.

## What You'll Build

A **Personal Business Intelligence System** with four features that flow into each other:

1. **Personal Brand Profiler** — Analyze your online presence using Gemini App
2. **Market Intelligence Scanner** — Research your target industry using NotebookLM
3. **Content Strategy Generator** — Create actionable content plan from your brand + market insights
4. **Action Dashboard** — Unified view of brand gaps, opportunities, and next steps

Each feature consumes the output of the previous one. By Feature 4, you'll have a complete personal positioning strategy—built with AI tools you already know.

## Tools You'll Use

| Tool | What For | Access |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Gemini App** | Brand analysis, content generation | gemini.google.com (free) |
| **NotebookLM** | Deep research, source synthesis | notebooklm.google.com (free) |
| **Claude Code** | SDD-RI workflow orchestration | From Chapter 14 |

No Python code required. You'll use AI tools to analyze, synthesize, and generate—then validate outputs against your specifications.

## The Intelligence Acceleration Challenge

You'll time each feature build. Track your progress:

| Feature | Target Time | Actual Time |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| F1: Personal Brand Profiler | Baseline | _____ min |
| F2: Market Intelligence Scanner | Faster than F1 | _____ min |
| F3: Content Strategy Generator | Faster still | _____ min |
| F4: Action Dashboard | **Less than 50% of F1** | _____ min |

If F4 takes less than half of F1, you've proven that reusable intelligence works.

## Why This Capstone?

Unlike hypothetical sales pipelines, this capstone uses:
- **Your real data** — Your LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolio (you own it)
- **Real target companies** — Companies you actually want to work with
- **Free accessible tools** — Gemini App and NotebookLM require only a Google account
- **Career value** — You leave with an actual personal brand strategy

## Prerequisites

- **Chapter 14 complete**: SDD-RI workflow familiarity (/sp.specify, /sp.plan, /sp.tasks, /sp.implement)
- **Chapter 13 complete**: You understand specification-driven development
- **Google account**: For Gemini App and NotebookLM access
- **Your profiles ready**: LinkedIn About section, GitHub bio, portfolio description

## Chapter Structure

| Lesson | What You'll Do |
