### **The Core Premise**

Traditional Computer Science (CS) degrees provide a necessary foundation but are no longer sufficient for the modern era. The lesson argues that **universities in 2025 are essentially teaching students how to be developers in 2015.**

### **1. The Root Cause: Structural Lag**
The disconnect is systemic, not a failure of educators.
* **University Cycle:** Updating a curriculum takes **2–4 years** (committees, textbooks, faculty training).
* **AI Cycle:** The industry evolves every **3–6 months**.
* **Result:** By the time a university course on a new technology is approved, the technology is often obsolete (similar to how mobile dev courses taught Objective-C while the industry moved to Swift and React Native).

### **2. The 5 Critical Gaps**
The lesson identifies five specific areas where traditional CS education fails to prepare students for AI-native development:

* **Gap 1: AI Collaboration:** Moving from manual syntax memorization to effective collaboration, prompt engineering, and reviewing AI-generated code.
* **Gap 2: Specification-Driven Development:** Shifting from "code first, figure it out later" to writing precise specifications (SDDs) that allow AI agents to implement correctly.
* **Gap 3: Agent Orchestration:** Evolving from a solo implementer to an orchestrator who decomposes problems and manages multi-agent workflows.
* **Gap 4: Modern Context Protocols (MCP):** Learning how to connect agents to data and manage context windows—a skill now as fundamental as understanding HTTP.
* **Gap 5: Real-World Problem Solving:** Moving beyond defined "toy problems" to solving ambiguous, complex issues using AI assistance to bridge the gap to production.

### **3. The Solution: Hybrid Learning**
The lesson does not advocate for quitting university. Instead, it proposes a **Hybrid Approach**:
* **Keep the University:** For enduring foundations (Algorithms, Data Structures, Architecture, Theory).
* **Add "The Book":** For rapid-cycle skills (AI workflows, Spec-driven dev, MCP, Agentic patterns).

### **Conclusion**
To thrive in 2025, a developer must combine the theoretical depth of a CS degree with the practical, fast-moving skills of AI-native software development.
