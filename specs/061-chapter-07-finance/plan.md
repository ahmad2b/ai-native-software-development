**Generated by**: chapter-planner v2.0.0 (Reasoning-Activated)

## I. Chapter Analysis

### Chapter Type

**Technical/Applied** - This chapter applies Claude Code skills (from Chapter 5) to finance-specific workflows. While non-technical in the coding sense, it is structured with sequential lessons teaching practical applications, not conceptual essays.

**Reasoning**: Target audience (finance professionals) needs hands-on application of Claude Code to their domain. Learning objectives include "apply," "implement," and "create" verbs indicating practical skill development. Each lesson produces actionable artifacts (CLAUDE.md files, prompt templates, workflow specifications).

### Concept Density Analysis

**Core Concepts** (from spec): 10 major concept clusters

1. AI reasoning vs rules-based automation (paradigm shift)
2. Three-layer architecture (Intelligence + Execution + Governance)
3. CLAUDE.md context files for finance domain
4. Prompt engineering for audit-ready outputs
5. Intent-driven financial modeling
6. Claude Code + Spreadsheet integration
7. Accounting workflow automation (classification, reconciliation, journal entries)
8. Scenario analysis and risk assessment
9. Multi-agent coordination patterns (conceptual)
10. Human-in-the-loop governance and compliance

**Complexity Assessment**: Standard (applied domain, no programming, but requires business/finance context)

**Proficiency Tier**: A2 -> B1 progression (non-technical professionals, building from foundational understanding to practical application)

**Justified Lesson Count**: 10 lessons + quiz

- Layer 1 (Manual Foundation): 2 lessons (paradigm shift, workspace setup)
- Layer 2 (AI Collaboration): 6 lessons (prompt engineering, modeling, spreadsheets, accounting, scenarios, governance)
- Layer 3 (Intelligence Design): 1 lesson (multi-agent patterns - conceptual)
- Layer 4 (Capstone): 1 lesson (integrated workflow specification)

**Reasoning**: 10 concept clusters across A2-B1 proficiency requires granular coverage. Finance professionals need heavy scaffolding initially (Layer 1), then extensive practice with AI collaboration (Layer 2 dominates), conceptual exposure to advanced patterns (Layer 3), and integration capstone (Layer 4). This matches spec's lesson structure exactly.

- [x] All lessons map to at least one eval

### Stage Progression Validation
- [x] Lessons 1-2: Layer 1 (Manual Foundation - paradigm, workspace)
- [x] Lessons 3-7, 9: Layer 2 (AI Collaboration with Three Roles)
- [x] Lesson 8: Layer 3 (Intelligence Design - conceptual multi-agent)
- [x] Lesson 10: Layer 4 (Spec-Driven Capstone)
- [x] No spec-first before Layer 4

### Cognitive Load Validation
- [x] A2 lessons (L1-L4): 5-7 concepts each (within A2 limit of 7)
- [x] B1 lessons (L5-L10): 5-7 concepts each (within B1 limit of 10)
- [x] No cognitive overload detected

### Dependency Validation
- [x] Within-chapter dependencies linear and satisfied
- [x] Cross-chapter dependency on Chapter 5 documented
- [x] Prerequisite chapter (Ch5) exists

### Three Roles Validation (L2 Lessons)
- [x] Each L2 lesson documents AI as Teacher scenario
- [x] Each L2 lesson documents AI as Student scenario
- [x] Each L2 lesson documents AI as Co-Worker (convergence) scenario
- [x] Framework remains INVISIBLE (no meta-commentary)

### Content Quality Requirements
- [x] Full YAML frontmatter structure defined
- [x] 3 "Try With AI" prompts per lesson specified
- [x] Source material mapping complete
- [x] Platform-agnostic approach (Xero, QuickBooks, generic patterns)
- [x] No programming required (natural language only)
- [x] Governance woven throughout (not isolated to L9)

```

### Directory Rename Required

Per spec FR-011: Delete `07-claude-code-for-professions/` and create `07-claude-code-for-finance/`

### Quality Reference

All lessons must match structure and quality of:
`apps/learn-app/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/05-claude-code-features-and-workflows/01-origin-story.md`

Key elements from reference:
- Full YAML frontmatter with pedagogical metadata
- Compelling narrative opening (real-world hook)
- Progressive concept introduction
- Tables comparing concepts
- 4 "Try With AI" prompts with varied focus
- Clear section structure with smooth transitions

### Validation Requirements

Before commit, all content must pass:
- `educational-validator` (per lesson)
- `validation-auditor` (chapter-wide)
- `factual-verifier` (chapter-wide for finance statistics)
- `pedagogical-designer` (chapter-wide)

## XI. Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Completion Time | 210 minutes total | Time tracking in lesson metadata |
| Try With AI Success | 90%+ actionable | Manual testing of prompts |
| CLAUDE.md Creation | 15 minutes | Lesson 2 timed exercise |
| Quiz Pass Rate | 80%+ | Quiz scoring |
| Capstone Usability | Immediately applicable | Rubric assessment |
| Proficiency Alignment | A2-B1 | Cognitive load validation |

---

**Plan Status**: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

**Next Step**: Invoke `content-implementer` subagent for each lesson, starting with Lesson 1, using this plan as specification.
