## The Agent Factory Thesis

> In the AI era, the most valuable companies won't sell software—they'll manufacture AI employees, powered by agents, specs, skills, MCP, autonomy and cloud-native technologies

### The Two Paths Framework

| Path | Tools | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **General Agents** | Claude Code, Gemini CLI | Reasoning systems for exploration | Research, debugging, **building Custom Agents** |
| **Custom Agents** | OpenAI SDK, Claude SDK, Google ADK | Purpose-built products | Standardized workflows, customer-facing products |

**Key Insight**: General Agents BUILD Custom Agents. This is the paradigm shift.

### Learning Progression

| Parts | Focus | Student Outcome |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **Parts 1-4** | Foundation (paradigm, tools, specs) | Understand Agent Factory model |
| **Parts 5-6** | Building blocks (Python, Agent SDKs) | Create reusable components |
| **Parts 7-8** | Infrastructure (Cloud Native, LLMOps) | Deploy & operate at scale |
| **Parts 9-10** | Frontend & Voice (TypeScript, Realtime) | Create user interfaces |
| **Parts 11-14** | Scale & monetize (Frontends, Organizations, Capstone) | **Sell Digital FTEs** |

## Implementation Status

| Status | Parts | Chapters |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Implemented** | Parts 1-10 | Ch 1-85 (mostly complete) |
| **Planned** | Parts 11-14 | Stubs only |

**Skill-First Learning Pattern** (Part 6+): Each technical chapter starts with L00 "Build Your [X] Skill" where students create a skill BEFORE learning content. Every lesson ends with "Reflect on Your Skill" section. This produces sellable skill portfolios (Digital FTE components).

## Directory Structure Reference

**For complete directory structure specification**: See **`specs/book/directory-structure.md`**

**Quick Reference**:

- Chapters are **directories** (not files): `apps/learn-app/docs/NN-Part-Name/NN-chapter-name/`
- Each chapter contains lesson files: `01-lesson-1.md`, `02-lesson-2.md`, etc.
- Chapter folders use **lowercase-with-hyphens**
- Part folders use **Title-Case-With-Hyphens**

**Examples**:

- Chapter 1: `apps/learn-app/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/01-agent-factory-paradigm/`
- Chapter 13: `apps/learn-app/docs/04-SDD-RI-Fundamentals/13-specification-driven-development-fundamentals/`
- Chapter 33: `apps/learn-app/docs/06-AI-Native-Software-Development/33-introduction-to-ai-agents/`
- Chapter 61: `apps/learn-app/docs/08-Turing-LLMOps-Proprietary-Intelligence/61-introduction-to-llmops/`

## Using This Index

**When creating a chapter**:

1. Find the chapter number and title in this index
2. Use the filename from this index
3. Place file in the correct part folder
4. Set `sidebar_position: [N]` in YAML frontmatter to the chapter number
5. Match the title exactly in frontmatter

**Agent Factory Alignment Check**: Before writing any chapter, ask:
- How does this chapter contribute to students building Digital FTEs?
- What reusable skills/patterns emerge from this content?
- Does this advance General Agent mastery or Custom Agent building?
