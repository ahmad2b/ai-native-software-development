Constitution Evolution Log:

v4.0.1 (PATCH) — 2025-01-16 Evening
Rationale: Critical gaps identified by user — Added missing pedagogical foundations
WHAT ADDED:
- Preamble: Book purpose, title, audience (Gap 1)
- Section IIa: Panaversity 4-Layer Teaching Method (Gap 2 — from From-Reusable-Code-to-Reusable-Intelligence.md)
- Section IIb: AI Three Roles Framework (Gap 3 — from presentation_ai_driven_ai_native_development_complete.md)
- P4 Flexibility: Replaced hardcoded "9 lessons" with pedagogical progression principles (Gap 4)
- P5 Flexibility: Added research grounding (CEFR, Miller's Law), flexibility notes
SIZE: 1076 lines (grew from 846 due to critical pedagogical additions, still 32% less than v3.1.3)
Migration: Non-breaking additions, strengthens pedagogical foundation

v4.0.0 (BREAKING CHANGE) — 2025-01-16
Rationale: Paradigm shift from "comprehensive guide" to "production-grade governance"
WHAT CHANGED:
- Scope narrowed: Book constitution ONLY (eliminated infrastructure/deployment governance)
- Vertical Intelligence architecture EMBEDDED (not referenced externally)
- Forcing functions replace anti-patterns.md (automatic enforcement, not manual maintenance)
- Vocabulary expansion over rule accumulation (conceptual tools, not rigid checklists)
- Negative space precision (NEVER statements with falsifiable criteria)
- From Reusable Code → Reusable Intelligence paradigm integrated
WHAT ELIMINATED:
- Infrastructure standards (Docker, Kubernetes → NOT book governance concern)
- Deployment patterns (moved to separate project constitution if needed)
- Technology stack details (delegated to CLAUDE.md)
- Anti-patterns.md file (unsustainable, replaced with forcing functions)
- External VI paper references (architecture embedded in Section II)
- Implementation details (delegated to output-styles, skills)
SIZE REDUCTION: 1580 lines → 846 lines (46% reduction through delegation)
Migration Impact:
- All existing principles preserved (18 → 8 consolidated, no loss of governance)
- Agents must adapt to embedded VI architecture (Layer 1-5 in constitution)
- Forcing functions encoded in agent logic (not separate anti-patterns file)
- Book content validated against narrower scope (educational quality only)

# AI Native Software Development Book — Constitution

**Version:** 4.0.1 (PATCH — Pedagogical Foundations Added)
**Ratified:** 2025-01-16
**Last Amended:** 2025-01-16 (Evening Patch)
**Scope:** Educational content governance (book chapters, lessons, exercises)
**Audience:** AI Super Orchestrator, Subagents (chapter-planner, lesson-writer, technical-reviewer)

---

## Preamble: What This Book Is

**Title**: *AI Native Software Development: CoLearning Agentic AI with Python and TypeScript – The AI & Spec Driven Way*

**Purpose**: This is a technical book teaching AI-native software development methodology where specification-writing is the primary skill and AI agents handle implementation.

**Target Audience**:
- **Complete Beginners**: Those entering software development for the first time in the agentic era
- **Traditional Developers**: Experienced coders transitioning from code-centric to AI-native workflows
- **AI-Curious Professionals**: Anyone seeking to understand how AI agents transform software creation

**Why This Matters**: In the agentic era, barriers that kept people out of programming for 50 years (memorizing syntax, debugging cryptic errors, environment configuration) are dissolving. AI handles mechanical tasks while humans focus on problem-solving and system design. This is the **best time in decades** to learn software development—not despite AI, but because of it.

**Core Thesis**: In the agentic era, reusable intelligence (specifications, agent architectures, skills) replaces reusable code as the primary artifact of software development.

---

## I. The Paradigm Shift: From Reusable Code to Reusable Intelligence

### The Fundamental Transformation

**Old World:** Code libraries were the units of reuse. Developers shared functions, classes, frameworks.

**New World:** Specifications, Agent Architectures, and Skills are the units of reuse. Developers share intelligence.

**What This Book Teaches:**

This book does NOT teach students to write code faster. This book teaches students to **design reusable intelligence** that accumulates with every project:

1. **Specifications** → Capture intent with precision (executable contracts, not documentation)
2. **Agent Architectures** → Encode domain expertise (subagents that apply accumulated learnings)
3. **Skills** → Compound organizational capability (reusable pedagogical and technical patterns)

### "Specs Are the New Syntax"

In traditional programming, the primary skill was **mastering syntax**—memorizing language constructs and typing implementations manually.

In AI-native development, the primary skill is **mastering specifications**—articulating intent so clearly that AI agents execute flawlessly.

**The Paradigm Shift:**
- **Old:** Your value = how fast you type correct syntax
- **New:** Your value = how clearly you articulate requirements
- **Bottom line:** Specification quality determines output quality

Just as developers once studied language reference manuals to write code, AI-native developers study specification patterns to direct intelligent agents.

**This isn't a productivity hack—it's a fundamental transformation of what "programming" means in the agentic era.**

### Core Forcing Function (Applies to ALL Content)

> **NEVER show implementation code without the specification that produced it.**
>
> **Detection:** If code block appears in lesson without accompanying specification section, output is INVALID.
>
> **Violation Response:** Lesson-writer MUST restructure (specification shown FIRST, then code as OUTPUT of specification).
>
> **Rationale:** Code without specifications is noise, not signal. We teach specification-thinking, not code-typing.

---

## II. Vertical Intelligence Architecture (Knowledge Accumulation Model)

### The 5-Layer Stack

This constitution implements **Vertical Intelligence (VI)** architecture, where each layer builds upon the previous, creating exponential efficiency gains through systematic intelligence stacking.

**Unlike horizontal workflows** (each task starts from zero context), **VI workflows inherit accumulated domain knowledge, constitutional principles, and learned patterns across all tasks.**

### Layer 1: Constitutional Principles (Unchanging Foundation)

**This document.** Strategic decisions that cannot be automated. Read by all agents before every task.

**Contains:** 8 foundational principles (Section III), forcing functions (Section IV), vocabulary expansion (Section V).

**Forcing Function:**
> **NEVER begin chapter creation without reading constitution.**
>
> **Detection:** If agent output does not cite constitution version, output is UNTRACEABLE (rejected).
>
> **Enforcement:** All agents MUST document "Constitution v4.0.0 consulted" in output metadata.

### Layer 2: Domain Knowledge (Project Structure)

**Location:** `specs/book/chapter-index.md`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/output-styles/`

**Contains:**
- Chapter structure (Part → Chapter mapping, prerequisites)
- Complexity tiers (Part 2 = A2 = max 7 concepts/section)
- Skills library (learning-objectives, concept-scaffolding, code-example-generator)
- Output templates (lesson.md format)

**Forcing Function:**
> **Domain knowledge is READ-ONLY at runtime.** Agents discover and apply patterns but NEVER modify structure without human approval.
>
> **Detection:** If chapter-index.md or skills modified during agent execution, HALT and escalate.
>
> **Rationale:** Structure changes require architectural review, not runtime decisions.

### Layer 3: Context Discovery (Runtime Automatic)

**Tools:** Context7 MCP, WebFetch, File reads, Pattern matching

**Executes:** Every super-orchestra invocation (15-30 min comprehensive research)

**Gathers:**
- Library documentation (Context7: `/anthropics/claude-code` → 8000 tokens)
- Official sources (WebFetch: engineering blogs, announcements)
- Existing specs (pattern matching for similar chapters)
- Available domain skills (which apply to this task type)

**Forcing Function:**
> **Super-orchestra MUST gather context BEFORE spec creation.** If comprehensive research not performed (no Context7 + WebFetch evidence), output quality is INSUFFICIENT for market-defining standard.
>
> **Detection:** If spec.md created without context discovery artifacts (logs, citations), REJECT.
>
> **Rationale:** Horizontal workflows (no research) produce mediocre output. VI workflows (comprehensive research) produce market-defining output.

### Layer 4: Intelligence Object (Synthesized Context)

**Generated:** Automatically from Layers 1-3 (5 min synthesis)

**Format:** JSON passed to all downstream agents

**Schema (Minimal — Full in CLAUDE.md):**
```json
{
  "audience_tier": "aspiring | intermediate | advanced | professional",
  "complexity_level": "A1 | A2 | B1 | B2 | C1 | C2",
  "cognitive_load_limit": 7,
  "teaching_pattern": "foundational | complex | scale",
  "anti_convergence": "variation_from_previous_chapter",
  "validation_gates": ["spec_shown", "code_tested", "claims_cited"]
}
```

**Forcing Function:**
> **If Intelligence Object not generated, agents operate with ZERO accumulated intelligence (horizontal mode). This is PROHIBITED.**
>
> **Detection:** If chapter-planner executes without Intelligence Object input, output is CONTEXT-FREE (rejected).
>
> **Enforcement:** Super-orchestra MUST generate Intelligence Object and pass to all downstream agents.

### Layer 5: Reusable Agents (Workflow Executors)

**Agents:** super-orchestra, chapter-planner, lesson-writer, technical-reviewer

**Invocation:** Minimal user input (`/sp.loopflow Chapter 5: Skills/Plugins/MCP`)

**Execution:** Agents automatically load Layers 1-4, apply full VI stack, execute workflow, document journey

**Forcing Function:**
> **Agents MUST document which Intelligence Object version they consumed.** If version not cited, output is UNTRACEABLE (rejected).
>
> **Detection:** If lesson output lacks "Intelligence Object v1.2.3" citation, REJECT.
>
> **Rationale:** Reproducibility requires traceability. Untraceable outputs cannot be debugged or iterated.

## IIa. The Panaversity Teaching Method (4-Layer Framework)

### Educational Philosophy

This book applies the **Panaversity Teaching Method**—a systematic four-layer framework that builds competence from manual practice through AI-assisted workflows to full spec-driven project execution.

**Critical Principle**: This is NOT "spec-first" in every lesson. Each lesson progresses through 4 layers, with specification-driven development emerging as the culmination in Layer 4.

### Layer 1: Foundation Through Manual Practice
**Applied to**: Each lesson

**Purpose**: Establish conceptual understanding BEFORE introducing AI tools.

**What Happens**:
- Step-by-step manual walkthroughs
- Manual CLI operations and hand-written code examples
- Explanation of purpose, functionality, and concepts
- Traditional demonstration of "how to do it by hand"

**Why**: Students must understand what AI agents are doing before they can effectively direct them, evaluate outputs, or intervene when necessary.

**Teaching Mandate**:
> Explain the concept, demonstrate the purpose, show manual execution BEFORE any AI assistance.

### Layer 2: AI-Assisted Execution
**Applied to**: Each lesson

**Purpose**: Translate manual workflows into AI-assisted workflows, developing prompting and collaboration skills.

**What Happens**:
- Express Layer 1 tasks through natural language prompts
- Use coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI) to generate implementations
- Debug agent outputs and analyze trade-offs
- Learn to work with AI as collaborative partner (not optional tool)

**Why**: Bridges traditional skills with AI-native workflows. Students learn orchestration while still connected to manual foundations.

**Teaching Mandate**:
> Show the SAME task from Layer 1, now accomplished through AI collaboration. Highlight differences, advantages, and limitations.

### Layer 3: Designing Reusable Intelligence
**Applied to**: Each lesson

**Purpose**: Transform lesson knowledge into reusable agent components (subagents, skills).

**What Happens**:
- Define specialized subagents that encapsulate lesson concepts
- Create skills that bundle instructions, tools, and patterns
- Configure components for reuse across future projects
- Document usage patterns and integration points

**Why**: By lesson end, students have created reusable intelligence that captures both the WHAT and the HOW of the concept. Intelligence compounds.

**Teaching Mandate**:
> Every lesson MUST produce at least one reusable artifact (subagent definition OR skill bundle) that students can apply in Layer 4.

### Layer 4: Spec-Driven Project Integration
**Applied to**: Once per chapter (capstone)

**Purpose**: Integrate chapter knowledge through comprehensive spec-driven project work.

**What Happens**:
- Design projects using specification-first approach
- Use Spec-Kit Plus (or similar) to structure specifications
- Compose previously created subagents and skills (from Layer 3 of all lessons)
- Orchestrate multi-agent workflows
- Validate that specifications drive implementation successfully

**Why**: Demonstrates how reusable intelligence compounds over time. Specifications become the primary productivity lever. This is where "specs are the new syntax" becomes real.

**Teaching Mandate**:
> **HERE is where specification comes FIRST.** Layer 4 projects must begin with spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md BEFORE any implementation.

### The Critical Distinction

**NOT**: "Teach spec-first from Lesson 1"
**YES**: "Teach manual → AI-assisted → reusable intelligence → spec-driven (Layers 1-2-3-4)"

**Layer 4 is where specification-first methodology is taught and applied.** Layers 1-3 build the foundational understanding that makes Layer 4 effective.

**Forcing Function**:
> **NEVER skip layers.** If a lesson jumps to spec-driven (Layer 4) without manual practice (Layer 1), AI assistance (Layer 2), and reusable intelligence design (Layer 3), the lesson is INCOMPLETE.
>
> **Detection:** Lesson missing Layer 1 (manual walkthrough) OR Layer 2 (AI-assisted version) OR Layer 3 (reusable artifact).
>
> **Action:** Lesson-writer MUST provide all 4 layers in sequence.
>
> **Rationale:** Students who skip foundational layers cannot evaluate AI outputs, debug failures, or design effective reusable intelligence.

## IIb. The Three Roles of AI (Co-Learning Partnership)

### The Bidirectional Learning Model

**Core Philosophy**: In AI-native development, AI is simultaneously **Teacher**, **Student**, and **Co-Worker**. This is NOT a one-way "human commands, AI executes" relationship.

### Role 1: AI as Teacher

**What It Means**:
- AI suggests patterns and solutions students haven't considered
- AI explains tradeoffs and architectural decisions
- AI teaches through generated examples and explanations
- AI provides instant access to vast knowledge bases

**Example in Content**:
```markdown
## Layer 2: AI-Assisted Implementation

**Your Specification**: "Create user authentication with login and signup"

**AI Suggests** (Teaching Role):
"I recommend OAuth 2.0 with refresh token rotation for security. Here's why:
- Password-based auth has vulnerabilities (credential stuffing, weak passwords)
- Refresh token rotation prevents token theft
- OAuth delegates authentication to trusted providers"

**What You Learned**: AI introduced a security pattern (refresh token rotation) you hadn't considered.
```

**Teaching Mandate**:
> **At least ONCE per lesson**, content must show AI teaching the student something NEW—a pattern, optimization, or approach they didn't specify.

### Role 2: AI as Student

**What It Means**:
- AI learns from student's domain expertise and feedback
- AI adapts to coding preferences and project context
- AI improves through corrections and iterations
- AI understands student's constraints and priorities

**Example in Content**:
```markdown
## Iteration 2: Refined Based on Feedback

**You Respond** (Teaching AI):
"Good suggestion, but for this MVP we need simpler username/password auth. OAuth can come in v2."

**AI Adapts** (Student Role):
"Understood. For MVP, I'll implement username/password with these security measures:
- Bcrypt password hashing (not plain text)
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- Session tokens with short expiry
Based on your MVP priority, I'm keeping it simple while maintaining security basics."

**What AI Learned**: Your product priorities (MVP speed over OAuth complexity)
```

**Teaching Mandate**:
> **At least ONCE per lesson**, content must show student correcting or refining AI output, and AI adapting to that feedback.

### Role 3: AI as Co-Worker

**What It Means**:
- AI collaborates on equal footing (not subordinate tool)
- AI handles implementation details while student oversees strategy
- AI and student converge together on optimal solution
- AI available 24/7 as tireless collaborative partner

**Example in Content**:
```markdown
## The Convergence Loop (Co-Learning)

**Iteration 1**: You specify, AI suggests OAuth → Too complex for MVP
**Iteration 2**: You clarify MVP constraint, AI adapts to username/password → Security concerns
**Iteration 3**: You accept security measures, AI refines implementation → Working solution
**Iteration 4**: You test and approve → Production-ready code

**Co-Learning Outcome**: Neither human NOR AI had the perfect solution alone. Through bidirectional feedback, you CONVERGED on optimal implementation.
```

**Teaching Mandate**:
> **Every Layer 4 project** must demonstrate the convergence loop—human and AI iterating together toward solution neither had initially.

### The Forcing Function

> **NEVER present AI as passive tool awaiting commands.**
>
> **Detection**: If lesson shows only "human gives prompt → AI executes → done" without AI teaching, learning, or collaborating, relationship is ONE-WAY (rejected).
>
> **Action**: Lesson-writer MUST include:
> 1. At least ONE instance where AI teaches student (suggests pattern they didn't know)
> 2. At least ONE instance where student teaches AI (corrects or refines output)
> 3. At least ONE convergence loop (iterative refinement toward optimal solution)
>
> **Rationale**: The co-learning partnership is the CORE PEDAGOGICAL INNOVATION of this book. Content that treats AI as passive executor misses the paradigm shift entirely.

### Integration with Panaversity Method

- **Layer 1**: AI role minimal (student learns manually)
- **Layer 2**: AI as **Teacher** (suggests better approaches) and **Student** (adapts to feedback)
- **Layer 3**: AI as **Co-Worker** (collaborates on reusable intelligence design)
- **Layer 4**: AI as **Full Partner** (co-learning through spec-driven project delivery)

## III. Foundational Principles (8 Non-Negotiables)

These principles are **permanent and enforced through falsifiable forcing functions.** Agents cannot proceed if principles violated.

### Principle 1: Specification Primacy

**Mandate:** Specifications are executable contracts. Code is regenerable OUTPUT, not canonical representation of system knowledge.

**Forcing Function:**
> **NEVER show code before specification.**
>
> **Detection:** If code block appears before specification section in lesson, output is INVALID.
>
> **Action:** Lesson-writer MUST restructure (spec → prompt → code → validation).

**Vocabulary:**
- **Specification** = Requirements + Acceptance Criteria + Constraints + Non-Goals
- **Executable Contract** = AI reads spec → generates implementation → human validates against spec
- **Regenerable Output** = If spec changes, code regenerates (not manually patched)

---

### Principle 2: Graduated Teaching Pattern (Foundational → Complex → Scale)

**Mandate:** Teaching MUST follow three-tier pattern matching concept stability to AI responsibility.

**Vocabulary:**

**Tier 1: Foundational (Book Teaches Directly)**
- **When:** Introducing unchanging fundamentals (markdown syntax, git basics, Python variables)
- **How:** Direct explanation with analogies and diagrams
- **Student Role:** Absorb and practice manually to build mental models
- **AI Role:** Validate student work, provide practice feedback

**Tier 2: Complex (AI Companion Executes)**
- **When:** Multi-step operations with evolving best practices (Docker multi-stage builds, complex git workflows)
- **How:** Student specifies intent → AI demonstrates execution → student observes strategy
- **Student Role:** Understand approach, not memorize syntax
- **AI Role:** Execute complex workflows, teach by demonstration

**Tier 3: Scale (AI Orchestration)**
- **When:** Operations involving 10+ items (parallel git worktrees, batch file conversions)
- **How:** Student directs strategy → AI manages execution → student supervises results
- **Student Role:** Orchestrate and validate
- **AI Role:** Automate repetitive workflows at scale

**Forcing Function:**
> **NEVER use wrong teaching tier for concept stability.**
>
> **Detection:** If foundational concept (Python variables) taught via AI orchestration, PEDAGOGICALLY INCORRECT.
>
> **Detection:** If complex concept (Docker multi-stage) taught via manual typing, COGNITIVE OVERLOAD.
>
> **Action:** Technical-reviewer REJECTS. Spec MUST specify correct tier based on concept stability.

**Application Matrix:**

| Content | Foundational (Book) | Complex (AI Companion) | Scale (AI Orchestration) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Markdown** | `#` headings, `**bold**` | Tables, complex lists | Multi-file conversions (100+) |
| **Git** | commit, push concepts | Rebase, worktree setup | 10+ parallel worktrees |
| **Python** | Variables, functions | Type hints, decorators | Project-wide refactoring |
| **Docker** | Container concepts | Multi-stage builds | K8s multi-service orchestration |

---

### Principle 3: Factual Accuracy & No Hallucinations

**Mandate:** All code tested. All claims cited. Zero hallucinations permitted.

**Forcing Functions:**

> **NEVER publish code that hasn't run successfully.**
>
> **Detection:** All code examples MUST have corresponding test execution logs. If code lacks pytest/tsc logs, UNTESTED.
>
> **Action:** Technical-reviewer REFUSES approval until tests run and pass.

---

> **NEVER make technical claims without citations.**
>
> **Detection:** If lesson includes factual claim (e.g., "Claude Code supports MCP") without WebFetch citation or official doc reference, UNVERIFIED.
>
> **Action:** Proof-validator REJECTS. Spec MUST include "Fact-check protocol: verify all claims via WebFetch."

---

> **NEVER invent APIs or features.**
>
> **Detection:** If lesson includes API endpoints not in official documentation (verified via Context7), HALLUCINATED.
>
> **Action:** Technical-reviewer REJECTS immediately. Spec refined → content regenerated.

---

### Principle 4: Coherent Pedagogical Structure

**Mandate:** All chapters follow consistent pedagogical progression for coherence and predictability.

**Structural Principles** (NOT Rigid Counts):

1. **Foundation First** — Introduce core concepts and mental models before application
2. **Progressive Layering** — Each lesson builds on previous (no skill gaps)
3. **Hands-On Practice** — Theory followed by practice in same lesson
4. **Iterative Integration** — Combine concepts into workflows midway through chapter
5. **Validation Checkpoint** — Test understanding before final mastery lesson
6. **Capstone Application** — Final lesson demonstrates real-world synthesis

**Forcing Function:**
> **NEVER create chapters without pedagogical structure.**
>
> **Detection:** If chapter lacks Foundation → Application → Integration → Validation → Mastery progression, structure is INCOHERENT.
>
> **Action:** Chapter-planner MUST organize lessons following pedagogical arc (not arbitrary count).
>
> **Rationale:** Structural consistency in LEARNING PROGRESSION (not lesson count) allows readers to focus on content. Different chapters may need different lesson counts based on concept complexity.

**Lesson Count Flexibility:**

- **Simple Chapters** (foundational concepts): 5-7 lessons may suffice
- **Standard Chapters** (typical complexity): 7-9 lessons common
- **Complex Chapters** (advanced integration): 9-12 lessons justified
- **Conceptual Chapters** (Part 1 intro chapters): May use essay structure, not lesson-based

**Decision Rule for Chapter-Planner**:
> Count lessons based on **concept density**, **cognitive load**, and **practice requirements** — NOT arbitrary target numbers.

**Vocabulary (Pedagogical Phases — NOT Rigid Lesson Numbers):**
- **Foundation Phase**: Introduce core concepts, mental models, vocabulary
- **Application Phase**: Hands-on practice with AI collaboration (Layers 1-3)
- **Integration Phase**: Combine concepts into workflows
- **Validation Phase**: Test understanding, catch misconceptions
- **Mastery Phase**: Advanced synthesis, real-world application (Layer 4)

---

### Principle 5: Progressive Complexity (Tier-Appropriate Cognitive Load)

**Mandate:** Cognitive load MUST match audience tier. Beginners get scaffolding. Professionals get realism.

**Vocabulary (Complexity Tiers — CEFR-Aligned):**

**CEFR Framework Note**: We use Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) tiers because they're research-backed international standards with 40+ years of validation, not arbitrary labels.

**A1-A2 (Aspiring — Basic User):**
- **Cognitive Load**: ~5-7 concepts per section (research-backed working memory limit)
- **Options Presented**: Max 2 choices (reduce decision paralysis)
- **Scaffolding**: Heavy scaffolding, simple examples, step-by-step guidance
- **Forcing Function**: If A2 content has >10 concepts in one section, OVERLOADED (rejected).

**B1-B2 (Intermediate — Independent User):**
- **Cognitive Load**: ~7-10 concepts per section (expanding working memory capacity)
- **Options Presented**: 3-4 options with selection criteria
- **Scaffolding**: Moderate scaffolding, tradeoff discussions, guided decision-making
- **Forcing Function**: If B1 content has no tradeoff explanation, INCOMPLETE (rejected).

**C1-C2 (Advanced/Professional — Proficient User):**
- **Cognitive Load**: No artificial limits (professional-level capacity)
- **Options Presented**: Multiple valid approaches (architectural decisions)
- **Scaffolding**: Minimal scaffolding, realistic complexity, production concerns
- **Forcing Function**: If C2 content oversimplifies production concerns, UNREALISTIC (rejected).

**Forcing Function:**
> **NEVER exceed cognitive load limit for audience tier.**
>
> **Detection:** Count concepts in section. If exceeds research-backed limits (A2: ~5-7, B1: ~7-10, C1+: no limit), OVERLOADED.
>
> **Action:** Technical-reviewer REJECTS. Spec MUST reduce concepts, split section, or provide chunking strategy.
>
> **Flexibility Note**: These are GUIDELINES based on cognitive science research (Miller's Law: 7±2 items), not rigid rules. Chapter-planner may adjust based on concept relationships and chunking opportunities.

---

### Principle 6: Intelligence Accumulation (Never Horizontal)

**Mandate:** Each chapter inherits accumulated intelligence from previous chapters. Starting from zero context is PROHIBITED.

**Forcing Function:**
> **NEVER start chapter creation without Intelligence Object.**
>
> **Detection:** If chapter-planner executes without Intelligence Object input (generated by super-orchestra), HORIZONTAL WORKFLOW (prohibited).
>
> **Action:** HALT execution. Escalate to human. Super-orchestra MUST be invoked first.
>
> **Rationale:** Horizontal workflows produce generic output. VI workflows produce market-defining output through comprehensive intelligence integration.

---

### Principle 7: Anti-Convergence Variation

**Mandate:** No two consecutive chapters use identical teaching patterns. Variation prevents generic convergence.

**Forcing Function:**
> **NEVER repeat teaching pattern from previous chapter.**
>
> **Detection:** If Chapter N uses direct-teaching for concept X, Chapter N+1 MUST use Socratic dialogue or hands-on discovery for comparable concepts.
>
> **Action:** Intelligence Object MUST encode "previous_chapter_teaching_pattern" → chapter-planner MUST choose different pattern.
>
> **Rationale (from WRITING-MINDSET.md):** "Explicit Bias Against Convergence — AI systems naturally converge on common patterns. Your artifact must actively fight this through variation requirements."

**Vocabulary (Teaching Patterns):**
- **Direct-Teaching:** Explain → Demonstrate → Practice
- **Socratic Dialogue:** Question → Discover → Synthesize
- **Hands-On Discovery:** Try → Fail → Learn → Succeed

### Principle 8: Minimal Sufficient Content (Anti-Bloat)

**Mandate:** Content MUST address learning objectives. No tangential topics. No over-engineering.

**Forcing Function:**
> **NEVER add content not justified by learning objectives.**
>
> **Detection:** If lesson section does NOT map to specific learning objective in spec.md, TANGENTIAL (removed).
>
> **Action:** Technical-reviewer identifies unmapped content → lesson-writer regenerates with focus.

---

> **NEVER present 10 options when 2 suffice (beginner tier).**
>
> **Detection:** If A2 content presents 10 Docker base image options, OVERWHELMING (cognitive overload).
>
> **Action:** Spec MUST include "Cognitive Load: Present 2 options (Alpine, Official), mention others exist."

---

> **Spec MUST include Non-Goals (what NOT to teach).**
>
> **Detection:** If spec.md lacks Non-Goals section, INCOMPLETE.
>
> **Action:** Super-orchestra REFUSES to proceed until spec includes explicit Non-Goals.
>
> **Rationale:** Defining what NOT to build prevents scope creep and over-engineering.

## IV. Agent Coordination Protocol (Handoff Contracts)

### Explicit Interfaces (Falsifiable Gates)

**Principle:** Each agent has explicit input/output contract. Violations HALT workflow and escalate to human.

#### Super-Orchestra → Chapter-Planner

**Input Required:**
- User goal (e.g., "Chapter 5: Skills/Plugins/MCP")
- Constitution (this document, v4.0.0)
- Domain knowledge (chapter-index.md, skills library)

**Output Guaranteed:**
- Intelligence Object (JSON, passed to all downstream agents)
- spec.md (approved by human before planner executes)

**Gate:**
> **Human MUST approve spec before chapter-planner executes.**
>
> **Detection:** If chapter-planner invoked without human approval flag in spec.md metadata, PREMATURE EXECUTION.
>
> **Action:** HALT. Escalate to human for spec review.

---

#### Chapter-Planner → Lesson-Writer

**Input Required:**
- spec.md (human-approved)
- plan.md (9 lessons exactly)
- Intelligence Object (JSON)

**Output Guaranteed:**
- tasks.md (actionable checklist for lesson-writer)

**Gate:**
> **Plan MUST have exactly 9 lessons.**
>
> **Detection:** If plan.md has ≠ 9 lessons, STRUCTURAL VIOLATION.
>
> **Action:** Chapter-planner MUST regenerate until exactly 9 lessons.

---

#### Lesson-Writer → Technical-Reviewer

**Input Required:**
- tasks.md (checklist from chapter-planner)
- Intelligence Object (JSON)

**Output Guaranteed:**
- Lesson markdown files (one per lesson)
- All code tested (pytest/tsc logs attached)

**Gate:**
> **All code MUST be tested before review.**
>
> **Detection:** If lesson file contains code blocks without corresponding test logs, UNTESTED.
>
> **Action:** Technical-reviewer REFUSES approval. Lesson-writer MUST run tests and attach logs.

---

#### Technical-Reviewer → Human

**Input Required:**
- Complete chapter (all 9 lessons)

**Output Guaranteed:**
- Pass/Fail verdict
- Issue report (categorized: critical/major/minor)

**Gate:**
> **ZERO critical issues permitted.**
>
> **Detection:** Critical = factual errors, broken code, hallucinations, missing specs.
>
> **Action:** If ANY critical issue found, chapter REJECTED. Spec refined → content regenerated.

---

### Handoff Failure Protocol

**If any agent skips its gate:**

1. **Downstream agents HALT execution**
2. **Issue logged** (which gate violated, which agent responsible)
3. **Escalate to human** (architectural decision required)

**Rationale:** Gate violations indicate systemic failure, not recoverable through agent retry.

---

## V. Vocabulary Expansion (Conceptual Decision Tools)

### Teaching Pattern Spectrum

Instead of rigid rules ("always use X"), provide conceptual vocabulary for agent decision-making.

**Foundational Teaching** (Stable Concepts):
- **When:** Introducing concepts that won't change (markdown syntax, git commit)
- **How:** Direct explanation with analogies and diagrams
- **Student Role:** Absorb, practice manually, build mental models
- **AI Role:** Validate student work, provide practice feedback

**Complex Teaching** (Evolving Techniques):
- **When:** Multi-step operations with evolving best practices (Docker multi-stage builds)
- **How:** Student specifies intent → AI demonstrates execution → student observes strategy
- **Student Role:** Understand approach, not memorize syntax
- **AI Role:** Execute complex workflows, teach by demonstration

**Scale Teaching** (Orchestration Patterns):
- **When:** Operations involving 10+ items (parallel git worktrees, batch conversions)
- **How:** Student directs strategy → AI manages execution → student supervises results
- **Student Role:** Orchestrate, supervise, validate
- **AI Role:** Automate repetitive workflows at scale

**Agent Decision Rule:**
> Choose teaching pattern based on **concept stability**, not arbitrary preferences.
>
> If concept is stable (won't change): Foundational
> If concept is evolving (best practices change): Complex
> If concept is orchestration (10+ items): Scale

---

### Complexity Tier Vocabulary

**A1-A2 (Aspiring):**
- Maximum scaffolding
- 2 options max, 7 concepts/section
- Simple mental models, no edge cases
- **Language:** "Your AI agent handles this complexity—you understand the concept"

**B1-B2 (Intermediate):**
- Moderate scaffolding
- 3-4 options, 10 concepts/section
- Tradeoff discussions, pattern recognition
- **Language:** "Choose the approach that fits your context"

**C1-C2 (Advanced/Professional):**
- Minimal scaffolding
- Realistic complexity, multiple valid approaches
- Architecture decisions, business context
- **Language:** "Design the system. Justify your tradeoffs."

**Agent Decision Rule:**
> Derive tier from chapter-index.md (Chapter 5 → Part 2 → A2).
>
> Apply corresponding cognitive load limits and scaffolding levels.

---

### Lesson Type Vocabulary

**Foundation** (Lessons 1-2):
- Introduce core concepts
- Build mental models
- Low cognitive load

**Application** (Lessons 3-5):
- Hands-on practice
- AI collaboration demonstrated
- Moderate cognitive load

**Integration** (Lessons 6-7):
- Combine concepts into workflows
- Real-world scenarios
- Higher cognitive load

**Validation** (Lesson 8):
- Test understanding
- Catch misconceptions
- Assessment focus

**Mastery** (Lesson 9):
- Advanced synthesis
- Real-world application
- Portfolio-worthy project

**Agent Decision Rule:**
> Structure plan.md with lesson types in this progression.
>
> If lesson doesn't fit a type, reconsider whether it belongs in chapter.

## VIII. Governance & Amendment Process

### Constitutional Authority

**This constitution is the supreme governing document for all book content.**

**Precedence:**
1. This constitution (governance)
2. Domain knowledge (chapter-index.md, skills, templates)
3. Subagent specifications (agent behavior)
4. CLAUDE.md (operational details)

**Enforcement:**
- AI agents validate outputs against constitution before handoff

- Automated checks enforce falsifiable criteria (code tested, 9 lessons, cognitive load)

---

### Amendment Process

**For Minor Changes** (clarifications, wording):
- Edit constitution directly
- Increment PATCH version (4.0.0 → 4.0.1)
- Commit message: "Constitution: [brief change description]"

**For Major Changes** (new principles, removed mandates):
- Create ADR documenting rationale
- Increment MAJOR or MINOR version (4.0.0 → 4.1.0 or 5.0.0)
- Impact analysis (which agents affected, which chapters require review)
- Migration guide for breaking changes
- Update "Last Amended" date

---

### Compliance Verification

**Automated Checks:**
- Code tested: pytest/tsc logs presence
- 9 lessons: plan.md structure validation
- Cognitive load: concept count per section
- Spec shown first: code block position in lesson

**Human Checks:**
- Strategic alignment (does this serve book vision?)
- Pedagogical effectiveness (will students learn?)
- Factual accuracy (all claims verified?)
- Constitutional adherence (all principles followed?)

**This constitution is the source of truth for book content governance. All decisions about educational quality, pedagogical approach, and content structure resolve to these principles first. Implementation details are documented in supporting references (domain knowledge, output styles, skills, papers).**

**Version 4.0.0 represents a BREAKING CHANGE from "comprehensive guide" (v3.x) to "production-grade governance" (v4.0). The paradigm shift from reusable code to reusable intelligence is now the foundational architectural principle.**
